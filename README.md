# NBA Shot Prediction 🏀📊

This project focuses on predicting the outcome of NBA shots using **Machine Learning**. It analyzes various in-game factors such as player position, shot distance, game time, and defender proximity to determine whether a shot will be successful.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project leverages data analytics and machine learning to enhance basketball shot prediction. The key steps involved are:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for insights
- Training and evaluating machine learning models
- Visualizing key factors affecting shot success

## 🚀 Features
✅ Utilizes real NBA shot data for training and testing  
✅ Implements multiple ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
✅ Provides insights into shot success probabilities  
✅ Visualizes player performance with charts and graphs  
✅ Optimized for high prediction accuracy  

## 📈 Visualization
- Visualized shot attempts on the court
- Visualized where most shots are taken on the court
- Visualized how shooting tendencies vary against different teams
